This repository provides a template for setting up a Python-Flask server. Follow the steps below to fork, set up, and run the server locally.

## Features
- Flask as the web framework
- Easy setup with a virtual environment
- Option to install necessary dependencies
- Ready to customize and extend for your project needs

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine
- `pip` (Python package installer) available
- (Optional) A terminal environment for macOS or Linux

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the server:

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Click the **Fork** button on the top right to copy this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
Set up a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated.

`python3 -m venv venv`

### Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment to use the correct Python version and libraries.

For macOS/Linux:
\`\`\`bash
source venv/bin/activate
\`\`\`

For Windows:
\`\`\`bash
venv\Scripts\activate
\`\`\`

### Step 4: Install Required Libraries (Optional)
If you have a `requirements.txt` file, install the necessary Python packages:

\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

### Step 5: Run the Flask Server
Once everything is set up, you can run the Flask server.

\`\`\`bash
python main.py
\`\`\`

The server will start, and you can view it in your browser at \`http://127.0.0.1:5000\`.

## Customization
You can modify the \`main.py\` file and add routes, business logic, or any other components your project requires.
